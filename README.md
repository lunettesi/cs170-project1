# cs170-project1

All of my code, JSON test files, and result examples are in this repository.

The code for the Angelica puzzle is in the file: project1_angelica_ai.py.

The code for the 8-puzzle, which I completed first before changing and adding aspects for the Angelica puzzle, is in the file: project1_8puzzle_ai.py.

The test files are JSON files, named angelica_depth0 to angelica_depth24. In order to run this program, 
write "python project1_angelica_ai.py (file name) (algorithm number)" in the command line. Additional test cases can be created with a JSON file.

The results for running each test case with each algorithm can be found in the files result_alg1 to result_alg3.
