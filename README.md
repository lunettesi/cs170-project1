All of my code, JSON test files, and result examples are in this repository.
<br/><br/>
The code for the Angelica puzzle is in the file: project1_angelica_ai.py.
<br/><br/>
The code for the 8-puzzle, which I completed first before changing and adding aspects for the Angelica puzzle, is in the file: project1_8puzzle_ai.py. 
Since the Angelica puzzle code was built from the 8-puzzle code, this file has a lot of the revision history in the header.
<br/><br/>
The test files are JSON files, named angelica_depth0 to angelica_depth24. In order to run this program, 
write "python project1_angelica_ai.py (file name) (algorithm number)" in the command line 
(e.g. python project1_angelica_ai.py angelica_depth20.json 3, which runs the depth 20 puzzle, using the Manhattan Distance heuristic). 
Additional test cases can be created with a JSON file.
<br/><br/>
The results for running each test case with each algorithm can be found in the files result_alg1 to result_alg3.
